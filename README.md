This cleo script
 - Increases traffic density to max possible
 - Works with aggressive traffic cheat
 - Makes players car invulnerable
 - Instantly deletes dead peds and cars

Latest update:
 - With Aggressive Traffic cheat on:
   - Peds on foot try to jack vehicles
   - Peds in cars are constantly fleeing themselves
 
 - With and without Aggressive Traffic cheat on:
   - Traffic and ped density increased
   - Script disabled during mission (easy to change!)
   - Players car is heavier than other traffic
   - Constantly empties vehicle and ped mempool

Installation
 - Make sure you are running the version 1 exe
 - Download and install Cleo
 - Download and install SilentPatch
 - Move [Kamakaze_cars.cs](https://github.com/bytes-ls/gtasa_kamakaze_cars/raw/master/cleo/Kamakaze_traffic.cs) to your GTA San Andreas/cleo folder
 - Play and enjoy!

Notes
 - You can usually play for a long time, but it's not entirely stable. Game will crash every so often, and I haven't tested it with the LimitAdjuster script

For even more fun, use the supplied handling.cfg to give cars insane stats - completely optional!
