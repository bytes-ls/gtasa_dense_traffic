# GTA: San Andreas Kamakaze Traffic
Cleo script for insane traffic mod

This cleo script
 - Increases traffic density
 - Makes traffic aggressive
 - Makes players car invulnerable
 - Instantly deletes dead peds and cars

Latest update:
 - Peds on foot try to jack vehicles
 - Peds in cars are constantly fleeing themselves
 - Traffic and ped density increased further
 - Script now disabled during mission (easy to change!)
 - Players car is now heavier than other traffic
 - Game no longer crashes when players car hits water

Installation
 - Make sure you are running the version 1 exe
 - Download and install Cleo
 - Move Kamakaze_cars.cs to your GTA San Andreas/cleo folder
 - Play and enjoy!

Notes
 - You can usually play for a long time, but it's not entirely stable. 
    Game will crash every so often, and I haven't tested it with the LimitAdjuster script


For even more fun, use the supplied handling.cfg to give cars insane stats
