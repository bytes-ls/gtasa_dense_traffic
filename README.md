This cleo script
 - Increases traffic density
 - Makes traffic aggressive
 - Makes players car invulnerable
 - Instantly deletes dead peds and cars

Latest update:
 - Peds on foot try to jack vehicles
 - Peds in cars are constantly fleeing themselves
 - Traffic and ped density increased further
 - Script now disabled during mission (easy to change!)
 - Players car is now heavier than other traffic
 - Game no longer crashes when players car hits water

Installation
 - Make sure you are running the version 1 exe
 - Download and install Cleo
 - Download and install SilentPatch
 - Move Kamakaze_cars.cs to your GTA San Andreas/cleo folder
 - Play and enjoy!

Notes
 - You can usually play for a long time, but it's not entirely stable. Game will crash every so often, and I haven't tested it with the LimitAdjuster script
 - Don't try to run the game with the Aggressive Drivers cheat on. It makes all the peds wanted and all those cops will surely crash the game. Again, LimitAdjuster might fix   this. 

For even more fun, use the supplied handling.cfg to give cars insane stats
